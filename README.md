Project Brief: 
    This webpage is intended as the main page for a fictitious bed and breakfast. The content of this page is responsive (both mobile and tablet screens.) 
    Thank you for your time in reviewing my project. 

  
- Media Queries: 
    1. Hero Banner changes for three different screen widths. 
    2. On mobile, the navigation bar changes into a hamburger button. 
    3. The image directory at the bottom of the page adjusts from a single row as the desktop view to columns (with complementing size adjustments) for tablet and mobile views. 
    4. The footer switches the social media and email sections from a row to a column as well. 

- JavaScript:  
    1. Image Carousel: Explaination needed
    2. Email Validation: Using the function validateEmail and the variable mailformat the information entered must match a standard email format. If it matches, an alert informs the user their information is correct. If it does not, an alert advises them to retry.  

- CSS: Also seen in Media Queries
