# CL.FALL2021.ABA

Project Brief: 
  
- Media Query 1: Created a hamburger menu for mobile screens. 
- Media Query 2: Adjusted hero for tablet and mobile screens.
- JavaScript:  Email Validation: Using the function validateEmail and the variable mailformat the information entered must match a standard email format. If it matches, an alert informs the user their information is correct. If it does not, an alert advises them to retry.  
- JavaScript: Image Carousel: In the HTML file, under the section labeled Image Carousel the images selected for the slides were designated the class "mySlides." In the Javascript file they are passed through a loop that increases by one therefore changing the position of the image. 

- Css Flex box: The image directory at the bottom of the page changes as the screen decreases in size. For Desktop the images are arranged in columns and for tablet and mobile devices switches to rows with the text inside the image.
